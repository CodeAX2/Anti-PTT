# Anti-PTT
I don't like push to talk in discord, so this program will disable it for me. 

## About This Project
Have you ever been in a discord server, excited to play a game with some new friends, 
when all of a sudden your find out that they require push to talk? How annoying,
constantly having to hold down a button in order to say anything. Fingers get sore,
you get enraged, and end up losing the game, all because you had to use PTT! Enter
Anti-PTT! It records a given input when you load it up, and then sends said input to
discord over and over in a new thread, ensuring that your mic will always be open.

## Things I Learned During Development
This application uses many of Window's built-in functions for sending
and recieving inputs from the mouse/keyboard. I had to learn how to
properly setup inputs, manage window handles, etc. (A lot of time was
spent looking on forums and the Microsoft Docs).
